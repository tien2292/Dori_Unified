**Dori Unified** is a GPU-accelerated multiphysics simulation engine built on the **WebGPU API**, designed to run directly in the browser. It unifies multiple physics domains into a single, portable, zero-install framework.


## Features
### GPU-Accelerated Multiphysics Solver

Dori Unified leverages **WebGPU** to execute physics solvers entirely on the GPU, enabling high-performance simulations directly in the browser.

- Real-time or near real-time performance  
- Full utilization of modern GPU parallelism  
- No native installation required  

This allows complex, large-scale simulations to run efficiently without traditional native or CPU-only constraints.

### Unified Physics Coupling
Dori Unified supports tight coupling between multiple physics systems, allowing realistic interaction across domains.

- Fluid · Rigid · Granular · Cloth phases combined  
- Bidirectional force exchange  
- Stable, scalable multiphysics simulation  

This unified approach enables complex physical behaviors within a single engine.

### Browser-Native & Zero-Install
Dori Unified runs entirely in the browser, removing platform and installation barriers.

- Cross-platform compatibility  
- Zero-install execution  
- Easy web-based deployment  

Ideal for research, education, demos, and interactive applications.

### Visualization & Rendering Ready
Designed to integrate seamlessly with modern web rendering pipelines.

- Real-time visualization  
- WebGL / WebGPU renderer integration  
- Interactive simulation exploration
